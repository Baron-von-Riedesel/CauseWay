 This repository contains the CauseWay DOS Extender, both v3.xx and v4.04
 (Open Watcom). If necessary, sources have been adjusted to Masm v6 syntax.
 If JWasm is used, it probably should be v2.19 or better.

 The CauseWay linkers WarpLink and WL32 are in a separate repository.

 The main source parts are:

 CW    : CauseWay EXE maker
 CW349 : the CauseWay Extender v3.xx ( 3.49/3.52? )
 CW404 : the CauseWay Extender v4.04 ( supplied with Open Watcom )
 CWD   : the CauseWay Debugger
 CWL   : (internal) CauseWay Linker ( obsolete )
 CWC   : CauseWay File Compressor
 CWLIB : library modules to support CauseWay assembly programs

 The CauseWay DOS Extender is in the Public Domain. It was a commercial
 product written mainly by Michael Devore in the early 1990s.
