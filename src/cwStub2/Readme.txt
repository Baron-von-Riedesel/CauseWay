 cwStub2.exe may replace the standard cwstub.exe. cwstub.exe actually
 is the CauseWay extender, in compressed format, while cwstub2.exe is
 just some bootstrap code that searches the (uncompressed) CauseWay
 extender (CW32.EXE) in the current directory and in the directories
 contained in the PATH environment variable.
