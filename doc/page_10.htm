<B>DPMI</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Force DPMI rather than default VCPI usage whenever possible (recommended for 386^Max and BlueMax users).
The memory manager must support DPMI or else this setting is ignored.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>EXTALL</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Force CauseWay to use all extended memory and sub-allocate memory from the bottom up instead of the
default top-down approach under RAW memory environments (no DPMI host, no EMM, no HIMEM.SYS loaded). This setting is most
useful for processor intensive environments which have a small hardware CPU cache. Use of this setting means that no extended
memory will be available for other programs while the application is loaded (including shelling to DOS).

<B>HIMEM:<I>nnn</I></B><BLOCKQUOTE>Set maximum physical (conventional plus extended) memory that can be consumed by CauseWay.
<I>nnn</I> is the decimal number of kilobytes that can be consumed. If memory allocation requests exceed this figure, CauseWay
will use virtual memory, even if additional physical memory is present. If the HIMEM memory value exceeds available physical
memory, then memory allocations operate normally. For example, HIMEM:2048 on a 4M machine would force virtual memory use after
2M of memory allocations (including loading the executable file). The remaining 2M of memory could be used by other
applications while the CauseWay application is active.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>LOWMEM:<I>nnn</I></B><BLOCKQUOTE>Set amount of DOS (conventional) memory not to be used by CauseWay.
 <I>nnn</I> is the decimal number of kilobytes to reserve, the default is 256 kB (in previous versions this was 32 kB).
 If there is not enough conventional memory to satisfy the <I>nnn</I> request value, then CauseWay will leave
 all conventional memory free that is not required by the extender to operate. 
 Note that this option does not guarantee the amount of free DOS memory, just how much needs to be free before
 CauseWay will consume DOS memory after exhausting all extended memory.
 For example, LOWMEM:200 will attempt to reserve 200K of DOS memory, even if CauseWay has exhausted all extended
 memory and is using conventional memory to fill memory allocation requests.
